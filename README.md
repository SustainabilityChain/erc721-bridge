# Bridge for ERC721 token

The goal of these contracts and scripts is to
allow users to transfer non-fungible tokens(NFT)
between two Ethereum networks.

## Deployment steps

### Home Deployment (Sokol)

1. Deploy [ERC721 Token](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/contracts/ERC721.sol)
    (Example address: '0xa51120080cd19c6dd35a1154e3fdaa770555f746')
    that will be used as Home ERC721 contract
2. Deploy [Bridge Contract](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/contracts/Bridge.sol)
    (Example address: '0xba1ecd4b35953cc578f773580e6aecd3128e5775')
    that will be used as Home Bridge contract.
    To deploy, use the address of ERC721 contract which was deployed on step 1
    as the first parameter.
    A second parameter is a number of signatures required to transfer NFT
    from one network to another.
    The third one is an array with addresses of all authorities who can transfer NFT

### Foreign Deployment (Kovan)

1. Deploy [ERC721 Token](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/contracts/ERC721.sol)
    (Example address: '0xa51120080cd19c6dd35a1154e3fdaa770555f746')
    that will be used as Foreign ERC721 contract
2. Deploy [Bridge Contract](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/contracts/Bridge.sol)
    (Example address: '0xba1ecd4b35953cc578f773580e6aecd3128e5775')
    that will be used as Foreign Bridge contract.
    To deploy, use the address of ERC721 contract which was deployed on step 1
    as the first parameter.
    A second parameter is a number of signatures required to transfer NFT
    from one network to another.
    The third one is an array with addresses of all authorities who can transfer NFT

## Running bridge

1. Write down your private key in [privateKey.json](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/validator/privateKey.json)
    (Example private key: '0x48656c6c6f2c20776f726c6448656c6c6f2c20776f726c6448656c6c6f2c2048').
    The address corresponded to specified private key should be listed as an authority in bridge contracts
2. Write down addresses of Home and Foreign Bridges in file [contracts.json](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/validator/contracts.json)
3. Run [bridge.py](https://github.com/rimrakhimov/erc721-bridge/blob/master/validator/bridge.py) that will be the main script of the bridge
